emanuef@algonquincollege.com

Week 1:

hello.c & helloworld.c - inclass example and explainer on why we use hello world 
    in any langauge we set up in an environment: tests library install, tests output, tests compiling.
anatomy.c - mentioned that this describes code using the language of an academic essy.
gdb-refcard.pdf - cheat sheet for GNU debugger. 
cboiler.json - use this example to automate the snippet for C code, this way you ensure that your name
    is in all of the code you submit. This is for VSCode, for other editors you can simply use a 
    template file. In VSCode the snippets are under: File->Preferences->Configure Snippets

/slides lecture 1 - the slides used in the lecture class. I will cull these after the lecture and 
    put up a new deck for the next lecture.

https://youtu.be/uh5fyJnxIc4 is a video I created on basic programming concepts if you want a 
    refresher on what we'll cover in the class. 


Week 2: 





* Note: other code not mentioned consists of starting code for examples I plan on using in future lectures.
