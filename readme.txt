CST8234_S25 - C Programming GitHub Repository
(c) 2025 Prof. Frank Emanuel, Ph.D. 
emanuef@algonquincollege.com

Week 1:

hello.c & helloworld.c - inclass example and explainer on why we use hello world 
    in any langauge we set up in an environment: tests library install, tests output, tests compiling.
anatomy.c - mentioned that this describes code using the language of an academic essy.
gdb-refcard.pdf - cheat sheet for GNU debugger. 
cboiler.json - use this example to automate the snippet for C code, this way you ensure that your name
    is in all of the code you submit. This is for VSCode, for other editors you can simply use a 
    template file. In VSCode the snippets are under: File->Preferences->Configure Snippets

/slides lecture 1 - the slides used in the lecture class. I will cull these after the lecture and 
    put up a new deck for the next lecture.

https://youtu.be/uh5fyJnxIc4 is a video I created on basic programming concepts if you want a 
    refresher on what we'll cover in the class. 


Week 2: 

scope.c - experiment regarding code tracing and scoping of variables. 
whatstring.c - reading the command line arguments.
arrays.c - we looked at this code briefly and then turned to command line arguments.
shape.c - example code exercise using problem decomposition and prioritizing tasks by dependencies.
    Finished the tasks we were working on, and tested that the size was now a useful number. Also
    fixed up the string array initialization, we can create an array of character pointers.

    put up a new deck for the next lecture. 

Week 3(4):

shape.c - example code exercise continued with writing our first utility function.
printfunction.c - showing some of the functionality of the standard print function.
funstuff.c - used for examples around the structure of functions as well as a loop to list all ASCII
    characters to see if extended ASCII is supported by default. Also demonstrated what happens when 
    you try to print an escape character.
inputtest.c - demonstration of some of the limitations of the standard scan function. We also talked
    about the concept of streams. 

/slides lecture 3 - slides for the lecture class.


Week 4:

pointers.c - example code of the basics of pointers in C.
lecture4example.c - looking at the address returned by dynamic memory allocation.
favnum.c - example code exercise using dynamic memory allocation (in progress)
allocate.c - the favourite number example completed for comparison purposes.

/slides lecture 4 - slides for the lecture class. 

Week 5: 

favnum.c - example code exercise.
utility.h and utility.c - creating our own library and the use of header guards on macros.

/slides lecture 5 - slides for the lecture class.

Week 6: (MIDTERM EXAM)
memory.c - basics of using pointer notation on arrays. 

/slides lecture 6 - slides for the tutorial after the midtern (12:15PM)



* Note: other code not mentioned consists of starting code for examples I plan on using in future lectures.
