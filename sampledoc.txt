Snakes are elongated, legless reptiles found in a wide variety 
of habitats across the world. They belong to the suborder 
Serpentes and are closely related to lizards. Snakes have 
evolved unique adaptations, such as flexible jaws that 
allow them to consume prey much larger than their heads. 
Their bodies are covered in scales, which help reduce 
friction as they move and provide protection from the environment.

Most snakes are carnivorous, feeding on animals ranging from 
insects and rodents to birds and even other reptiles. They 
use different hunting strategies, including constriction and 
venom injection, to subdue their prey. Venomous snakes possess 
specialized glands and fangs to deliver toxins, which can 
immobilize or kill their targets quickly.

Despite their reputation, snakes play a vital role in maintaining 
ecological balance. They help control populations of pests and 
serve as prey for larger animals. While some species can be 
dangerous to humans, most snakes are harmless and prefer to 
avoid confrontation. Understanding and respecting these 
fascinating creatures can lead to safer interactions and 
greater appreciation for their role in nature.
